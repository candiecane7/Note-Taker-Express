## Collaborators
[link](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/javascript-array-find-index-of-object-by-property) This blog helped me figure out how to get the index of an object in an array by using the id.
[link](https://www.tabnine.com/code/javascript/functions/express/Router/delete) Found how to write a delete request through this link.
[UNIQID](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uniqid) npm package I used to create a unique id for each note.

## User Story
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
